This project visualizes fish sightings on an interactive world map. Key features include:

Dynamic display of fish sightings using sample data (replaceable with actual database integration).
Filtering functionality based on the profession of the reporter (e.g., fishers, divers, beachgoers).
Popups on map markers showing details like species, photo, and reporting profession.
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Leaflet.js library for map rendering.
